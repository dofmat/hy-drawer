<script src="https://unpkg.com/hy-drawer/dist/vanilla/hy-drawer.min.js"></script>
~~~

</script>
~~~

### Gold Standard
This component follows the WebComponents [Gold Standard](doc/gold-standard.md){:.flip-title}.

### Source
The source code is written in a *literal programming* style, and should be reasonably approachable.
However, some knowledge of [RxJS] is required.

The core functionality is implemented in [`mixin / index.js`](doc/source/mixin/README.md),
which is used to create the framework-specific versions of the component.
